#KELLYANNE SORT

The Greatest, Fastest Array Sorter, Huge!
 
The KELLYANNESORT method Sorts an Integer array in the most efficient way possible, I asked a group of the best programmers what they thought and they all agreed, they said "Tc2r, Its the Bestest way of sorting Arrays, no doubt!".

@Params: 
A context, used for displaying the toast alert. 
An integer array to be sorted. 


It sorts your Integer Array by completely ignoring it, and printing out a new, sorted array with "Alternative Values."

If the new array does not appear sorted, you have been manipulated by the lying Media, Sad!
